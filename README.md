## Inspiration
The idea for Purrstrology came from my love for cats and looking at zodiac sign information. I wanted to combine the two in a fun and interactive web application.

## What it does
Purrstrology allows users to discover their "celestial feline friend" based on their zodiac sign. Users input their birthdate, and the application matches them with a cat that corresponds to their zodiac sign.

## How I built it
Purrstrology was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Python with the Flask framework can be used to run program with `flask --app run run`. The frontend was designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, while the backend logic handles the zodiac sign determination and cat matching process.

## Challenges I ran into
One of the main challenges I faced was making sure everything is responsive-designed as well as integrating the back-end with the front-end.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud that I was about to create a unique and engaging experience for users that combines elements of astrology and feline companionship. Additionally, overcoming the technical challenges involved in building a web application from scratch was another significant accomplishment.

## What I learned
Throughout the entire process, I learned how to use the Flask framework for the first time.

## What's next for Purrstrology
In the future, I plan to expand Purrstrology with personalized cat profiles.
